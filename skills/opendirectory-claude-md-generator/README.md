Reads your codebase and writes a CLAUDE.md that gives Claude Code the context it needs: build commands, code conventions, architecture notes, and gotchas. Stays under 200 lines.

## Install

```bash
npx "@opendirectory.dev/skills" install claude-md-generator --target claude
```

### Video Tutorial

### Step 1: Download the skill from GitHub
1. Copy the URL of this specific skill folder from your browser's address bar.
2. Go to [download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/).
3. Paste the URL and click **Enter** to download.

### Step 2: Install the Skill in Claude
1. Open your **Claude desktop app**.
2. Go to the sidebar on the left side and click on the **Customize** section.
3. Click on the **Skills** tab, then click on the **+** (plus) icon button to create a new skill.
4. Choose the option to **Upload a skill**, and drag and drop the `.zip` file (or you can extract it and drop the folder, both work).

> **Note:** For some skills (like `position-me`), the `SKILL.md` file might be located inside a subfolder. Always make sure you are uploading the specific folder that contains the `SKILL.md` file!

## What It Does

- Scans project files: package.json, tsconfig.json, linter configs, Makefile, directory structure
- Extracts all build, test, lint, and dev commands
- Identifies code style conventions that differ from defaults (path aliases, export patterns, naming)
- Maps non-obvious architecture decisions
- Finds gotchas: auto-generated files, required env var setup, test dependencies
- Generates CLAUDE.md using Gemini, then verifies it stays under 200 lines
- If CLAUDE.md already exists, improves it without discarding custom content

## Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose | How to Set Up |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Gemini API key | CLAUDE.md generation from codebase analysis | aistudio.google.com, Get API key |

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add GEMINI_API_KEY
```

## How to Use

From the project root you want to document:
```
"Generate a CLAUDE.md for this project"
"Create a CLAUDE.md"
"Write Claude configuration for this repo"
"Help Claude understand this codebase"
```

To update an existing CLAUDE.md:
```
"Update my CLAUDE.md: we added Vitest and changed the build system"
"Improve my existing CLAUDE.md"
```

## What Goes in CLAUDE.md

| Section | Include | Skip |
|---------|---------|------|
| Commands | Exact runnable commands, flags needed, env vars required | `npm install` and other obvious ones |
| Architecture | Non-obvious structure, auto-generated directories | "src contains source files" |
| Code Style | Path aliases, export conventions, non-default settings | Indent size (formatter handles it) |
| Testing | Required setup, how to run one test | "we use Jest" (visible from package.json) |
| Gotchas | Auto-generated files, env var order, known intentional issues | Things derivable from the code |

## Why Under 200 Lines

Long CLAUDE.md files get ignored. Claude loads the full file into context every session: a bloated CLAUDE.md with obvious content trains Claude to skim it. A tight 100-150 line CLAUDE.md with only non-obvious facts gets read and used.

The skill cuts aggressively: if a section says only things Claude can infer from the code, it removes it.
